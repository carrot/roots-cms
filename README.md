Roots-CMS
=========

A tool for easier dynamic content management in [roots](http://roots.cx/) projects.

> **Note:** This project is in early development and the only feature currently available is reordering your dynamic content. Tests and content editing features planned for future releases.

### Installation

`npm install roots-cms -g`

### Usage

`roots-cms` in your roots project directory

This starts an Express server and opens a browser to a GUI app for managing your dynamic content files. When you're finished editing, `<ctrl>+c` to stop the web server. All your changes should be written to your dynamic content files, ready for you to commit and deploy!
